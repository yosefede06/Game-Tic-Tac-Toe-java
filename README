Strategy of the automatic players:
    - Whatever: Chose randomly a coordinate from all the blank blocks of the board.
    - Clever: Fills blank blocks of the board horizontally in order from left to right and from rows to columns,
              in the following way: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2),...,(n-1, n-2),(n-1,n-1).
    - Genius: Fills blanks blocks of the board vertically in order from left to right and from columns to rows, starting
              from (1, 1) and in case no more blocks are available on that interval starts filling the first column.

The advantage of designing the software in such a way that each of the player classes implements a common interface,
is that we can add new players easily by just focusing on the logic of each player without no need of
caring again about all those aspects players already have in common like the board, the rules of the game or the
user interface.
